# weather-app

---

This project was based on Js basic knowledge. Using Openweather app and unsplash API, I was able to fetch data in order to have daily weather information by city.
As a feature :

- Style app
- A picture as background each time we look for a city
- Icon that represent weather conditions.

I'm posting some pictures in regard of my job.
